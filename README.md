# Woodcarvings
I like to make woodcarvings of animals, so here I will have albums of my carvings.

On some of my future projects, I plan on using a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/) with [Blynk](https://www.blynk.cc/) to add some lights to them. I will put any of my code in this repo.


Until I get that set up, I will just post some pictures of my projects on here.


# My Carvings
These are only the ones I have pictures of, I have about 15 others from the past year that I didn't take pictures of.


Because I'm doing these for fun in my free time and I often work on several projects at the same time, some of the timeframes are a little long, it it not necessarily indicitive of how much work I put into it.

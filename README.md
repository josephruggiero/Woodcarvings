# Woodcarvings
I like to make woodcarvings of animals, so here I will have pictures of my carvings.

I use hand tools (knifes, gouges, saws) for about 95+% of the carving. I occasionally use a dremel for cleaning up edges and polishing.


# My Carvings
These are only the ones I have pictures of, I have about 15 others from the past year+ but I don't have pictures of them. I already gave most of mine away, so it will be a while until I get pictures.

### Mechanical  Pencils
The 2-part pencil is a pencil I made a long time ago out of bloodwood

The 1-part pencil was made May-2018, out of [mystery wood from Rockler](http://www.rockler.com/12-pack-assorted-hardwood-pen-blanks)
